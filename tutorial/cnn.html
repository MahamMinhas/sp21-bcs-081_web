    China on Monday indicated that leader Xi Jinping would skip an important gathering
     of the world’s 20 top economies for the first time with Premier Li Qiang traveling
      to the event in New Delhi this weekend in his place.
   Xi’s absence from the G20 summit comes as tensions simmer between China and
    host country India, especially over their disputed border and New Delhi’s growing 
    ties with the United States.
    The no-show of China’s top leader – unprecedented since the first
     such summit was held in 2008 – will likely be seen as a snub to India,
      which is hosting the powerful group of world leaders for the first time 
      amid efforts to boost its global clout under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
